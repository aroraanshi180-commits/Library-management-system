📚 Library Management System
**A robust, CLI-based backend system for managing book inventories.**

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a logic-heavy terminal application built to handle the day-to-day operations of a library. It focuses on the core principles of software engineering: data persistence, efficient searching, and error handling.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Persistent Storage:** Uses File Handling to save and retrieve data even after the program closes.
* **Inventory Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books and user records.
* **Search Engine:** Implemented custom algorithms to find books by ID or title quickly.
* **Data Integrity:** Includes input validation to prevent system crashes or data corruption.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C
* **Concepts:** File I/O, Structs, Pointers, Sorting/Searching Algorithms.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
2. Compile the source code:
